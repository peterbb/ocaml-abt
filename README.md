# Abstract Binding Trees

This is an implementation of abstract binding trees (ABT) in Ocaml.
A user of the library defines two modules, implementing 
the interfaces `SORT` and `OPERATOR`, and the library will from
this give:

* A module implementing multi-sorted abstract binding trees with
names and symbols.
* A pretty printer and a parser.
